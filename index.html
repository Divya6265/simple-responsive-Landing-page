                    <p class="tip-text">Breaking up big projects into smaller, more manageable pieces helps
                        you stay focused and productive. For example, if you've got a long
                        assignment due, break it into a timeline of smaller assignments such
                        as researching, outlining, writing, and proofreading.

                        Having an established routine helps you stay on track and be productive. A routine can include scheduling specific activities such as studying, cleaning your room, or going out for a walk. Set a designated time each day for completing each task and you'll be more productive!

                    <p class="tip-text">Before you start any project, take some time to set specific goals and
                        objectives. It's easier to stay focused and productive when you have a
                        clear roadmap to follow. Make sure you write down your goals and
                        objectives so you can refer back to them as you progress.

                        procrastination. Prioritize tasks according to their urgency and
                        importance and tackle them one at a time so you don't get overwhelmed
                        and lose focus.</p>
